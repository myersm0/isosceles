ISSUE: Stanza and spaCy disagree on tense/mood for this finite verb.
STANZA: {current}
SPACY: {expected}
CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Tense=Imp means IMPARFAIT (imperfect), NOT imperative. Do not change correct imparfait tags.
- Tense=Past means PASSÉ SIMPLE. Many 1sg/3sg passé simple forms look like present tense.
- Mood=Cnd is conditional. The -ais/-ait endings are shared with imparfait, but conditional has a future stem.
- Consider the narrative context: is this a completed action (passé simple), ongoing/habitual (imparfait), or conditional?
Determine the correct tense/mood for this form in context. If the current annotation is wrong, provide corrected feats. Otherwise no_change.
