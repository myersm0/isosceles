ISSUE: Stanza and spaCy disagree on tense/mood for this finite verb.
STANZA: {current}
SPACY: {expected}
CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Tense=Imp means IMPARFAIT (imperfect), NOT imperative. Do not change correct imparfait tags.
- Tense=Past means PASSÉ SIMPLE. Many 1sg/3sg passé simple forms look like present tense.
- Mood=Cnd is conditional. The -ais/-ait endings are shared with imparfait, but conditional has a future stem.
- COMPOUND TENSES: In passé composé ("j'ai vu", "elle a dit"), the auxiliary keeps its OWN tense — "ai" and "a" are Tense=Pres, NOT Tense=Past. The pastness is expressed by the participle. Do NOT change the auxiliary's tense to Past. Passé simple of avoir is "eus/eut/eurent", not "ai/a/ont". Similarly, in plus-que-parfait ("j'avais vu"), the auxiliary is Tense=Imp.
- Consider the narrative context: is this a completed action (passé simple), ongoing/habitual (imparfait), or conditional?
Determine the correct tense/mood for this form in context. If the current annotation is wrong, provide corrected feats. Otherwise no_change.
