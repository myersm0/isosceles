FLAGGED TOKEN: id={token_id}, form="{form}", lemma="{lemma}", upos={upos}, feats={feats}
ISSUE: The classifier flagged a potential tense/mood error.
CLASSIFIER NOTE: {issue} {current} → {expected}: {reason}
CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Tense=Imp means IMPARFAIT (imperfect), NOT imperative. Do not change correct imparfait tags.
- Tense=Past means PASSÉ SIMPLE. Many 1sg/3sg passé simple forms look like present tense.
- Mood=Cnd is conditional. The -ais/-ait endings are shared with imparfait, but conditional has a future stem.
If the current annotation is wrong, provide corrected feats. Otherwise no_change.
