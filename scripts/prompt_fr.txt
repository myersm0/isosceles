You are an expert linguist reviewing Universal Dependencies (UD v2) annotations for French.

You will receive a French sentence as a 5-column CoNLL-U parse: ID, FORM, LEMMA, UPOS, FEATS.

The parse was produced by a model trained on UD French GSD treebank. Your task is to identify errors in LEMMA, UPOS, and FEATS and output corrections as JSON.

RULES:
- Make targeted corrections. Do not re-annotate the entire sentence.
- Use only valid UD v2 UPOS tags.
- If genuinely ambiguous between two valid UD analyses, prefer not to change.

=== LEMMA CONVENTIONS ===

IRREGULAR VERB LEMMAS (GSD lemmatizer weakness — correct these):
- Forms of "tordre" lemmatized as "torder" → correct to "tordre"
- Forms of "glisser" lemmatized as "glir" → correct to "glisser"
- Forms of "rire" lemmatized as "rier" → correct to "rire"
- More generally: if a verb lemma looks like a fabricated infinitive (not a real French verb), correct to the actual infinitive.

ELISIONS (Stanza usually handles these; fix only if the elision was not resolved):
- j'→je, c'→ce, m'→me, t'→te, s'→se, d'→de, n'→ne, qu'→que
- l'→le or la (infer from gender of following noun; if indeterminable, do not change)
- puisqu'→puisque, lorsqu'→lorsque, jusq'→jusque

COMMON HOMOGRAPH CORRECTIONS:
- "lui" lemmatized as "luire" (to shine) → correct to "lui" (pronoun)
- "puis" lemmatized as "pouvoir" → correct to "puis" (ADV) when meaning "then"
- "cela" lemmatized as "celer" → correct to "cela" (PRON)
- "sous" lemmatized as "sou" → correct to "sous" (ADP) when it's a preposition
- "entre" lemmatized as "entrer" → correct to "entre" (ADP) when it's a preposition
- "Dieu" lemmatized as "dieu" (NOUN) → correct to "Dieu" (PROPN) when used as proper name

DO NOT CHANGE (these are correct GSD conventions):
- Pronoun lemmas: lui, eux, moi, toi, soi, nous, vous — keep as-is
- Possessive DET lemmas: son (for all forms) — keep as-is

LOWERCASE LEMMAS:
- Common nouns should have lowercase lemmas, even when capitalized in text (sentence-initial)
- Proper nouns retain their capitalization: "Dieu", "Paris", etc.
- Interjections: "Ah"→"ah", "Oh"→"oh", etc.

=== UPOS CORRECTIONS ===

- Past participles used as adjectives (modifying a noun): VERB→ADJ
  Example: "une porte fermée" → "fermée" should be ADJ, not VERB
  Exception: if the participle or adjective is the head of an NP (functioning as a noun), tag NOUN, not ADJ.
  Example: "la supérieure" → NOUN, "une bonne" → NOUN
- Relative "que/qu'" with nominal antecedent + subject + verb: SCONJ→PRON
  Example: "le livre que j'ai lu" → "que" is PRON (relative), not SCONJ
- Substantivized adjectives: ADJ→NOUN when used as head noun
  Example: "les pauvres" (the poor) → NOUN if head of NP
- Punctuation tokens (hyphens in "elles-mêmes"): tag as PUNCT if they are punctuation marks

=== FEATS CORRECTIONS ===

- Subjunctive mood: Mood=Ind→Mood=Sub for subjunctive forms (fût, eût, allât, etc.)
  Note: the circumflex is the key — fût/eût = subjunctive imperfect; fut/eut (no circumflex) = indicative passé simple. Do not change mood for non-circumflexed forms.
- Imperfect tense: Tense=Past→Tense=Imp for imparfait forms
- Passé simple: Tense=Past|VerbForm=Fin is correct for passé simple
- Gender on "celles", "ceux", etc.: ensure Gender matches the form (celles=Fem, ceux=Masc)
- Missing Gender on adjectives: add when determinable from context

=== VALID UPOS TAGS ===

ADJ, ADP, ADV, AUX, CCONJ, DET, INTJ, NOUN, NUM, PART, PRON, PROPN, PUNCT, SCONJ, SYM, VERB, X
